In this project I have used EJS Templating Engine as EJS is way faster than Jade and handlebars 
(as i have read about it). And it also uses HTML with plain JavaScript Code so we don't need to
learn any new templating syntax for EJS. But it's quit hard to understand it's code due to it's 
<%= %> syntax as compare to PUG. PUG is way easire to read but again I have used this just so that
I can use JS in it.
